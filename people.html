          Dr Marek Grzybowski obtained his PhD under the supervision of Prof. Daniel T. Gryko at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences (IOC PAS), where he worked on novel π-conjugated systems based on diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs). He then spent three years in Japan as a JSPS postdoctoral fellow in the group of Prof. Shigehiro Yamaguchi at the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules (ITbM), Nagoya University. There, he developed phosphorus-bridged analogues of xanthene fluorophores for bioimaging applications, including the PREX710 marker. In 2020, he began his independent research career at IOC PAS as the head of Research Group 10A. His team focuses on a variety of innovative fluorescent π-systems, particularly lightweight NIR-II emitters, macrocyclic fluorophores, and CPL-active molecules. He’d love to know how and where the π-electrons flow.

          Dr Eng. Kinga Kuczyńska earned her PhD under the supervision of Prof.
          Zbigniew Pakulski at the Institute of Organic Chemistry Polish Academy
          of Science (IOC PAS), where her research focused on the application of
          lupane-derived triterpenes in the synthesis of biologically active
          compounds. Subsequently, she pursued a two-year postdoctoral
          fellowship at the University of Michigan (USA) in the
          Grembecka–Cierpicki Group, concentrating on the design, synthesis, and
          development of small-molecule therapeutics for targeted cancer
          treatment. At present, she continues her scientific career as a
          postdoctoral researcher in the group of Dr Marek Grzybowski at the
          Institute of Organic Chemistry, PAS, with her current work centered on
          the synthesis of donor–acceptor cyclacene analogues.

          Krzysztof Nowak received his MSc with distinction from the Warsaw University of Technology, defending his thesis successfully in 2022. He joined Marek Grzybowski’s research group in 2019, initially focusing on the synthesis of chiral fluorescent macrocycles based on 2,5-diaminoterephthalate units. He started his PhD studies in 2022, concentrating on the synthesis of donor-acceptor and acceptor-acceptor pentacene analogues. In his personal life, he enjoys cooking and studying history.

          Weronika Szawro graduated from Warsaw University of Technology in 2023. Both her B.Eng. and M.Eng. theses, carried out under the supervision of Prof. Sergiusz Luliński, focused on the synthesis of novel biologically active compounds—benzosiloxaboroles. In 2023, she joined the research group of Dr. Marek Grzybowski, where she is currently pursuing her Ph.D. Her work is centered on the synthesis of donor–acceptor tetracenes, pentacenes, and structurally related analogues.

          Maciej Multan is pursuing a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics at the University of Warsaw as a student of the Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MISMaP). He has been interested in natural and exact sciences since a young age, but later his interests oriented towards chemistry, and then specifically to organic chemistry. Subsequently, he began participating in various internships and chemistry competitions, including the Polish Chemistry Olympiad. He also started working at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, PAS. As a member of the M. Grzybowski Research Group, his work focuses on donor-acceptor scaffolds, mainly novel and highly emissive quinacridone derivatives. Apart from chemistry, he is a great sports enthusiast as well as a backpacker with a passion for mountains and northern destinations.

          Maciej is currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry and Nanoengineering at the University of Warsaw. His scientific career started in early 2022 in Prof. Piotr Kaszyński’s group, where he worked on partially fluorinated liquid crystals while still in high school. After starting university in late 2023, he joined Dr. Marek Grzybowski’s group, where his research focuses on single-benzene-based fluorophores and fluorene analogues of xanthene dyes.
